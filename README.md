# n8n Automated Storytelling 🎬🐺  
**AI Video Generator | Automated Storytelling Pipeline | Cinematic Content Creation**

This repository contains a **fully automated storytelling pipeline built in n8n**, designed to transform **a simple text idea into a cinematic AI-generated video**.  
It orchestrates multiple AI services into a single workflow: **story generation, image creation, voice synthesis, soundtrack composition, storage management, and final video rendering**.  

This is not just automation – it’s a **modular creative production line powered by AI**.  

---

## 📊 System Architecture

The workflow is designed as a **modular pipeline**, where each API plays a role:

1. **Slack Bot Command** (`/render`) – Entry point  
2. **LLM Story Engine** – Generates a structured narrative (split into scenes)  
3. **Scene Assets Generation** –  
   - **Images**: Replicate + RunwayML  
   - **Voiceovers**: ElevenLabs text-to-speech  
   - **Music**: AI soundtrack composition  
4. **Asset Management** – Files uploaded & linked via Dropbox  
5. **Video Rendering** – Creatomate assembles all components with a customizable template  
6. **Delivery** – Final cinematic video link sent back into Slack

## 📸 Workflow in Action

### 1. Full Workflow in n8n  
A complete **orchestration pipeline**, where every node handles one part of the creative process.

---

### 2. Slack Bot Integration  
Control everything directly from Slack. Just type `/render` + your idea → watch it turn into a finished cinematic video.

---

### 3. Video Rendering in Creatomate  
Creatomate composes all generated assets (voice, music, images, videos) into a **cohesive cinematic output**.

---

### 4. Creatomate Template  
The **core of the magic**: the video template. Here you define layers, placements, transitions, and timings.  
The more refined the template, the more professional the result.

## ⚙️ APIs & Tools

This workflow uses a combination of **state-of-the-art AI APIs**:  

- [Replicate](https://replicate.com) → Image + music generation  
- [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com) → Still image → AI video  
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) → Natural TTS voiceovers  
- [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) → Asset storage & public links  
- [Creatomate](https://creatomate.com) → Automated video assembly  
- [Slack](https://slack.com) → Workflow control & delivery  

---

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow

- **Trigger**: Slack `/render` command  
- **AI Story Generation**: LLM creates multi-scene narrative  
- **Parallel Asset Generation**:  
  - Replicate generates unique images  
  - Runway converts images to motion  
  - ElevenLabs synthesizes voices  
  - AI API composes background music  
- **Sync Layer**: Dropbox stores and syncs files  
- **Assembly Layer**: Creatomate renders assets based on a video template  
- **Output**: Final cinematic video link auto-shared back to Slack  

---

⚡ **Deploy in minutes → Import JSON → Add API keys → Render cinematic videos directly in Slack.**  
From a simple text prompt → to story → to scenes → to video → all fully automated.  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download the workflow file**  
   - Grab the `StoryForge AI V2.09.25.json` from this repo.

2. **Import into your n8n**  
   - Open n8n → *Import Workflow* → select the JSON file.  
   - Save & activate.  

3. **Add your API keys** (required for automation):  
   - **Replicate API Key** → for images & music  
   - **RunwayML API Key** → for motion video  
   - **ElevenLabs API Key** → for TTS voice  
   - **Dropbox API Key** → for storage & links  
   - **Creatomate API Key** → for video rendering  
   - **Slack Bot Token** → for triggering via `/render`  

4. **Setup Slack**  
   - Install the bot in your workspace  
   - Create a command `/render` → point it to your n8n webhook  

5. **Run it!**  
   - Go to Slack → type:  
     ```
     /render A wolf pack guarding a mystical forest, with dark magic and fire.
     ```  
   - Wait a few minutes → receive a cinematic video link back in Slack 🎬

## 💰 Cost Model

- **Prototype/Testing**: Free tiers are enough for setup and short demos  
- **Production**: Long-form cinematic content requires paid API plans  
- ROI: For marketing, social media, or creative prototyping → cost is low vs value  

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Automated **AI storytelling** for social media (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts)  
- AI-generated **trailers & short films**  
- **Marketing video automation** for campaigns at scale  
- Creative **prototyping** for game devs, writers, and filmmakers  
- **Education & explainer videos** automated from text  

---

## 🔥 Extended Ideas & Automation Potential

This pipeline is just the starting point. With n8n you can expand infinitely:

- Auto-publish to **YouTube / TikTok / Instagram**  
- Add **Whisper AI** for automatic subtitles  
- Generate **multiple versions of the same story** for A/B testing  
- Auto-share previews in **Slack/Discord** for real-time feedback  
- Build a **marketing engine** → story in → video out → auto-posted  

⚡ Here’s the truth: **RunwayML alone makes videos. This workflow makes *productions***.  
Because it’s not one tool, it’s a **pipeline that connects everything**.  

The limit? **The sky.**
